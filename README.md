<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm a computer science enthusiast who is eager to learn new technologies that evolve every day in the field of Digital and Computer World. Currently, I'm knowledgeable in several topics, including cybersecurity, Web Development, Software Development, Databases, Microsoft 365 Suite, Secret Sharing Protocols, and data structures and algorithms. To enhance my skills across various domains, I have worked on numerous projects that combine at least two different domains. While working on this project, I have had the ability to exhibit leadership and team coordination skills. I can adapt to new changes soon, and I believe that I am a fast learner.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Florida Atlantic University | Graduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
<p>I have been working as a <b>Graduate Teaching Assistant</b> at Florida Atlantic University since <b>Jan 2025</b>. During my time in this role, I have helped students face problems they are afraid of, promoted conceptual and critical thinking, and solved problems using a combination of traditional and modern methods. Additionally, I have delivered lectures on topics that help students build a solid foundation, enabling them to understand the course more in-depth. While working, I have acquired skills such as <b>leadership, taking responsibility, strong presentation, communication, and interpersonal skills.</b> </p>

<h3>Ziroh Labs | Java Intern</h3>
<p>The role <b>Java Intern</b> at Ziroh Labs from <b>October 2023 to November 2023</b> allowed me to enhance my skills in <b>Core Java, Data Structures, and Algorithms, alongside some Machine Learning Algorithms such as K-nearest neighbours.</b> In this role, I helped build a custom database structure that allows the organisation to store data for an Artificial Intelligence feature efficiently and with minimal time complexity. The data structure is programmed to store a large amount of data using indexing and weightage. </p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Photo Sharing Application</h3>
<p> This project allows users to upload images and view the previously uploaded images by any user. Furthermore, when an image is uploaded, an <b>LLM API is called to generate a caption and description</b> of the uploaded image. The caption and description were saved to a text file with the same name as the image in the bucket where images were uploaded. Later, when the image is requested by a user, it is returned along with the caption and description. The requests are responded to by different instances deployed within the server to manage and coordinate traffic, maintaining low latency for each user. The project has several associated endpoints. Each endpoint has a different purpose. The technologies and stacks used in the project are, <b>HTML & CSS, Flask, Google Storage, Google Cloud Run, Google Generative AI. </b></p>

<h3>Exploiting the Power of Keys: Unveiling a Novel Authentication Architecture for Enhanced Web Application Security</h3>
<p>Architected and developed a unique <b>RESTful API</b> based authentication methodology using <b>Spring Boot and Postman</b> that relies on <b>AES encryption, SHA hashing, salting, and random string generation</b> to ensure <b>aggressive security</b>, generating a single and unique key that can be used for <b>authentication</b>, which significantly improves web application security</p>
