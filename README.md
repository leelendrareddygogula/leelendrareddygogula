<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Graduate Teaching Assistant @ Florida Atlantic University</h3>
<p>I have been working as a <b>Graduate Teaching Assistant</b> at Florida Atlantic University since <b>Jan 2025</b>. During my time in this role, I have helped students face problems they are afraid of, promoted conceptual and critical thinking, and solved problems using a combination of traditional and modern methods. Additionally, I have delivered lectures on topics that help students build a solid foundation, enabling them to understand the course more in-depth. While working, I have acquired skills such as <b>leadership, taking responsibility, strong presentation, communication, and interpersonal skills.</b> </p>

<h3>Java Intern @ Ziroh Labs</h3>
<p>The role <b>Java Intern</b> at Ziroh Labs from <b>October 2023 to November 2023</b> allowed me to enhance my skills in <b>Core Java, Data Structures, and Algorithms, alongside some Machine Learning Algorithms such as K-nearest neighbours.</b> In this role, I helped build a custom database structure that allows the organisation to store data for an Artificial Intelligence feature efficiently and with minimal time complexity. The data structure is programmed to store a large amount of data using indexing and weightage. </p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Photo Sharing Application</h3>
<p> This project allows users to upload images and view the previously uploaded images by any user. Furthermore, when an image is uploaded, an <b>LLM API is called to generate a caption and description</b> of the uploaded image. The caption and description were saved to a text file with the same name as the image in the bucket where images were uploaded. Later, when the image is requested by a user, it is returned along with the caption and description. The requests are responded to by different instances deployed within the server to manage and coordinate traffic, maintaining low latency for each user. The project has several associated endpoints. Each endpoint has a different purpose. The technologies and stacks used in the project are <b>HTML & CSS, Flask, Google Storage, Google Cloud Run, Google Generative AI</b>.

<h3>Exploiting the Power of Keys: Unveiling a Novel Authentication Architecture for Enhanced Web Application Security</h3>
<p>Architected and developed a unique <b>RESTful API</b> based authentication methodology using <b>Spring Boot and Postman</b> that relies on <b>AES encryption, SHA hashing, salting, and random string generation</b> to ensure <b>aggressive security</b>, generating a single and unique key that can be used for <b>authentication</b>, which significantly improves web application security.

<h3>Cryptostega Mesh: A Triadic Approach for Secure Information Transfer using Cloud Environments</h3>
<p>This paper presents an innovative approach where the information can be shared from one user to another in a secure way, where the transfer was user-specific, i.e., no person other than the sender and the intended receiver can even know that the data was shared. The methods used in this paper include <b>Cryptography, Steganography, and Cloud Computing.</b> This research implements a methodology that combines cryptography and steganography with cloud computing to provide enhanced <b>security, helping us avoid data security issues</b>. The implementation includes <b>RSA and DES encryption from Cryptography, data hiding in images using LSB Steganography</b>, configuring cloud sources for storage, <b>data transmission using cloud user management, and instant data deletion in the cloud</b> with the help of various services offered by the cloud environment. The analysis of this approach involves comparing the image obtained after steganography, which hides the encrypted data, with the original image used for steganography to determine whether the changes made to the image can be easily identified. It is presented using various types of graphs, including histograms, bar graphs, and difference images, which are further explained in the Results and Analysis section.

<h3>Web Security and Web Application Security: Attacks and Prevention</h3>
<p>The everyday life of a person goes on with the assistance of the internet at present. Without the internet, a person can do nothing. As the internet evolves, the threats related to it are becoming more rapid. Web applications are generally used over the internet, which helps users to provide their requested needs. As they are used over the internet, they are liable to many cyber-based attacks. Many security techniques have been developed over the years to build up the protection of web applications. Web application threats include both passive and active attacks. Prevention involves utilizing various tools, applying security standards during construction, and regularly assessing and mitigating risk factors to take action accordingly. In this article, we <b>discussed some of the major threats to web applications</b> such as <b>SQL Injection, Data Breach, Remote File Inclusion, Phishing Attacks, Man-in-the-middle, Denial-of-Service Attacks</b>,  and <b>presented some ways to ensure our web application is secure from the threats and vulnerabilities</b> found on the internet such as <b>Web Application Firewalls, Vulnerability Scanners, Fuzzing Tools, Penetration Testing, and Cloud Computing.</b> Link to the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10112741" target="_blank">publication</a>.</p>
