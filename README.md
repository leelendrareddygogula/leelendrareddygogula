<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Florida Atlantic University | Graduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
<p>I have been working as a <b>Graduate Teaching Assistant</b> at Florida Atlantic University since <b>Jan 2025</b>. During my time in this role, I have helped students face problems they are afraid of, promoted conceptual and critical thinking, and solved problems using a combination of traditional and modern methods. Additionally, I have delivered lectures on topics that help students build a solid foundation, enabling them to understand the course more in-depth. While working, I have acquired skills such as <b>leadership, taking responsibility, strong presentation, communication, and interpersonal skills.</b> </p>

<h3>Ziroh Labs | Java Intern</h3>
<p>The role <b>Java Intern</b> at Ziroh Labs from <b>October 2023 to November 2023</b> allowed me to enhance my skills in <b>Core Java, Data Structures, and Algorithms, alongside some Machine Learning Algorithms such as K-nearest neighbours.</b> In this role, I helped build a custom database structure that allows the organisation to store data for an Artificial Intelligence feature efficiently and with minimal time complexity. The data structure is programmed to store a large amount of data using indexing and weightage. </p>
